	APIs are the new normal when it comes to modern software architecture since they enable decoupling and easy communication between services. APIs are easy to own, deploy and operate by our teams, so we want to help our engineers with some guidelines to help them design, implement and maintain their APIs. 

	Our APIs enable us to build platforms that support our business needs. API First approach should be adopted in order to support those needs in a clear and structured way. API definition starts outside the code and ideally involves all actors that are relevant to the domain. API First encompasses a set of quality-related standards and fosters a peer review culture including a lightweight review procedure. We encourage our teams to follow them to ensure that our APIs:

	- are easy to understand and learn
	- are general and abstracted from specific implementation and use cases
	- are robust and easy to use
	- have a common look and feel
	- are consistent with other teams’ APIs and our global architecture
